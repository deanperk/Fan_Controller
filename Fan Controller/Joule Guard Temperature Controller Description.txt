Joule Guard Temperature Controller Description

It’s a differential temperature controller that turns fans on and off in
specially designed enclosures

It will cool the batteries when the night air is colder than the
batteries

It will warm batteries during the day when the outside air is 
warmer than the batteries

It does this by constantly comparing the temperature differential
between the batteries and the skin of the enclosure (top)

When the batteries are above 80F, the controller is in COOL mode
When the batteries are below 50F, the controller is in HEAT mode

Between 50 and 80F, is OKAY mode, we don’t do anything because the
battery is fine

The battery and enclosure temperature sensors are 10K thermistors

The alarm sensor will be a photocell in almost all cases, and will
control the load relay. It will be relabeled photo eye

The load relay is normally closed unless a photoeye is connected to
the sensor input, whereas it closes at dusk and opens at dawn

The relay is also programmed to disconnect the load if the battery
voltage falls below 11.0V, providing the LVD (Low Voltage Disconnect)
function.  It will reconnect at 12.5V after several days of recharging

The load relay has a switching capability of 1A
The F1 – F4  fan outputs have a combined output of 5A
